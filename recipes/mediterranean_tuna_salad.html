    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>With crunchy vegetables, fresh herbs, and a zesty Dijon dressing, this no-mayo Mediterranean tuna salad is loaded with flavor and nutrition. Once you try it, you will never go back to those heavy deli-style tuna salads!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Tuna. You'll need 2 to 3 cans of quality tuna, packed in water or olive oil. I use responsibly-caught Yellowfin Albacore tuna (look for the dolphin-safe label).</li>
        <li>Vegetables and Herbs. Cucumbers, celery, radish, onions, parsley and min, chopped into small bits will add crunch and great fresh flavor!</li>
        <li>Olives, Capers, or Pickles. Pitted and sliced kalamata olives or a handful of drained capers will add a nice briny and slightly salty flavor to this tuna salad recipe. This is a very Mediterranean thing to do, and if you're not a fan of olives or capers, you can chop up some pickles instead.</li>
        <li>Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>Lime juice and Lime Zest</li>
        <li>Greek extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Sumac and crushed red pepper flakes, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the dressing by whisking the Dijon mustard with the lime juice, olive oil, salt and pepper, sumac, and red pepper flakes (if you like a bit of heat). By the way, you can make the dressing a day or two in advance and keep it in the fridge in a tight-lid mason jar.</li>
        <li>Drain and add the tuna to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add in the remaining ingredients including chopped celery, English cucumber, radish, green onions, and red onions. Add in the olives (or capers).</li>
        <li>Pour the dressing all over the tuna and mix well.</li>
    </ol>
